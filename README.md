[Section 1: Visual Alterations]

LensEd empowers you with four default visual modes. These modes are carefully designed to reduce eye strain and enhance contrast, making your reading experience more comfortable and efficient.

Default Mode: The familiar web page you know.
Papyrus Mode: A clean and elegant layout to reduce eye strain.
Dark Mode: Perfect for low-light environments.
Fresh Mode: A vibrant, refreshing design.

Each of these modes maintain visual contrast to help those with color blindness or limited vision.


[Section 2: Customization]

We understand that websites come in all shapes and sizes. That's why we've given you the ability to customize your reading experience further. With the "Toggle Selection Mode," you can handpick specific sections of a web page to change the background color instantly. Double-click on the areas you want to convert, and the web page adapts to your preferences seamlessly.


[Section 3: Color Customization]

LensEd puts the power of color in your hands. Our intuitive color picker allows you to select the perfect background and font colors that suit your unique style and needs. Just choose a color, and LensEd will instantly provide you with a clear, easy-to-read display.


[Section 4: Font Variety]

Everyone learns differently, so we've included a wide selection of fonts to cater to your preferences. Whether you prefer the classic readability of Times New Roman for lengthy articles or the readability-enhancing Comic Sans for those with dyslexia, LensEd ensures that you have the right font for every occasion. We even have playful options like Fantasy to make your reading experience more enjoyable.
